# Solar System Explorer

Hey there! Welcome to the Solar System Explorer - a cool 3D journey through our solar system made with Three.js. This project lets you spin around the Earth and gawk at the other planets moving around the Sun. We've got some neat textures, nifty animations, and it's all from our home planet's POV.

Big shoutout to the folks over at [SuboptimalEng's three-js-games](https://github.com/SuboptimalEng/three-js-games.git) for their awesome Three.js example.

## Getting Started

To get this baby up and running on your machine, you'll need Node.js installed. Grab it, then run these commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies first
npm install

# To start seeing planets
npm run dev

# Ready to go live? Build it!
npm run build
```
